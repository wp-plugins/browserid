Implementation of Mozilla BrowserID for WordPress

== Description ==

As a user of BrowserID, you confirm your email addresses once. Then, you can sign into any web site that supports BrowserID with just two clicks.

This plugin adds a BrowserID login button to your login page. There is also a widget with a login button, which you can add to for example your side bar. It is possible to customize the login and logout button/link.

[BrowserID](https://browserid.org/ "BrowserID") is an open source experiment from the [Identity Team](http://identity.mozilla.com/ "Identity Team") at [Mozilla Labs](https://mozillalabs.com/ "Mozilla Labs").

**BrowserID and this plugin are experimental !**
